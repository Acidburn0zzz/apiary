# Apiary

*Nice little JS libraries sprout here.*

This is a collection of small JavaScript libraries or utilities leveraging [the W3C API](https://github.com/w3c/w3c-api).
These JS modules are intended to be used from W3C pages: domain pages, group pages, personal pages, etc.
Examples of use are also included.

Refer to [the W3C API](https://github.com/w3c/w3c-api) and [its documentation](https://api-test.w3.org/doc) for details.

## Getting started (quickly)

1. Include this in your page:
```html5
<script src="//www.w3.org/scripts/jquery/2.1.4/jquery.min"></script>
<script src="scripts/domain-or-group-info.js"></script>
```
2. Specify the ID of the *entity* you want, adding a *data-* attribute to the `html` element, eg:
```html5
<html data-domain-id="41381">
```
3. Put *placeholders* where you'll need real data about that *entity*, eg:
```html5
The lead of this domain is: <span class="w3capi w3capi-lead"></span>.
```

## Reference

The `html` element should have one of these two *data-* attributes: `data-domain-id`, `data-group-id`.

A placeholder is any element with a class beginning with `w3capi-`.
Bear in mind that a new chunk of DOM will be inserted there; whatever that placeholder contains will be lost.
It is recommended that you

These are the supported placeholders, the types of entities they apply to, and the kind of content they generate:
* `w3capi-name` (*domain*, *group*): text
* `w3capi-lead` (*domain*): text
* `w3capi-activities` (*domain*): `ul`
* `w3capi-type` (*group*): text
* `w3capi-description` (*group*): text
* `w3capi-chairs` (*group*): `ul`

The class `w3capi` isn't used by the JS libraries, but we recommended you add it to all placeholders for easier CSS styling.
